## Approach & Efficiency
1.  The first thing specify the problem (search binary)
2. Draw simple diagram to understand the idea of search key
3. Try to write the code for this part
4. Write the whole code using java language
5. Run the code to be sure is it correct
6. write the test cases
7. Drawing the data structure in whiteboard

it took one hour  and test cases then draw the whiteboard.
Time Complexity (O( n))
Space Complexity (O(1))

## Solution
I have problem with code I tried it on different PC and it works
