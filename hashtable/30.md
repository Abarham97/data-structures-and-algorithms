# Hash Table 
create a Hashtable class in Java with specific methods:

set: This method should hash a given key and store the key-value pair in the table, handling collisions. If the key already exists, it should update the associated value.

get: Given a key, return the associated value from the table.

has: Given a key, return a Boolean indicating if the key exists in the table.

keys: Return a collection of all unique keys in the hashtable.

hash: Given a key, return the index in the table where that key is stored.

## Approach & Efficiency
Step 1: Initializing the Hashtable

Create a class for the Hashtable with constants for INITIAL_CAPACITY and LOAD_FACTOR_THRESHOLD.
Initialize an array to hold the entries (buckets) and a size counter.
Step 2: Hashtable Construction

Create a constructor for the Hashtable class to initialize the table and size.
Step 3: Adding an Element (set)

Implement the set method to insert a key-value pair.
Calculate the hash of the key to determine the index in the table.
Handle potential collisions using techniques like linear probing.
Check if resizing is needed when the load factor exceeds the threshold.
Step 4: Retrieving a Value (get)

Implement the get method to retrieve the value associated with a key.
Calculate the hash of the key to find the value in the table.
Step 5: Checking for Key Existence (has)

Implement the has method to check if a key exists in the Hashtable.
Utilize the get method and return true if a value is found, otherwise return false.
Step 6: Retrieving All Keys (keys)

Implement the keys method to retrieve all unique keys in the Hashtable.
Iterate through the table, collecting keys into a collection (e.g., a list).
Step 7: Hashing Function

Create a method for hashing keys to determine the index in the table.
Step 8: Handling Collisions

Implement collision handling, e.g., using linear probing to find the next available slot in the table when there's a collision.
Step 9: Resizing the Hashtable

Implement resizing logic for the Hashtable.
When the load factor exceeds the threshold, double the table size and rehash the elements.
Step 10: Entry Class

Create an inner Entry class to represent key-value pairs, used for storing data in the Hashtable.


- average-case time complexity of Hashtable operations is O(1), which means they are generally very efficient for lookups and insertions. The worst-case scenarios, where time complexity reaches O(n)
- space complexity factors :

O(initial capacity) + O(N) + O(bucket overhead) + O(resizing overhead)
