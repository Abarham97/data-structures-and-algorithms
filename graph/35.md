# Graph 
implement a basic graph data structure with the following functionalities:

Vertex Addition: Implement a method to add a vertex to the graph.

Edge Addition: Implement a method to add a directed edge between two vertices with a given weight. Ensure that self-loops are not allowed, and if an attempt is made to add a self-loop, throw a SelfLoopException.

Vertices Retrieval: Implement a method to retrieve a collection of all vertices in the graph.

Neighbors Retrieval: Implement a method to retrieve all neighbors of a given vertex.

Neighbors with Weights: Ensure that when retrieving neighbors, the weight of the edge between the vertices is included.

Graph Size: Implement a method to return the number of vertices in the graph.

Graph with Single Vertex and Edge: Write a test to ensure that a graph with only one vertex and one edge (without self-loop) is handled correctly.

## Approach & Efficiency
Define Graph Class:

Create a class named Graph to represent the graph data structure.
Implement Vertex Addition:

Create a method addVertex(Vertex vertex) to add a vertex to the graph.
Implement Edge Addition:

Implement a method addEdge(Vertex source, Vertex destination, int weight) to add a directed edge between two vertices with a specified weight.
Throw a custom exception (e.g., SelfLoopException) if a self-loop is detected.
Implement Vertices Retrieval:

Implement a method getVertices() to return a collection of all vertices in the graph.
Implement Neighbors Retrieval:

Implement a method getNeighbors(Vertex vertex) to return all neighbors of a given vertex.
Implement Neighbors with Weights:

Implement a method getNeighborsWithWeights(Vertex vertex) to return a map of neighbors with their corresponding edge weights.
Implement Graph Size:

Implement a method getSize() to return the number of vertices in the graph.
Implement Graph with Single Vertex and Edge:

Write a test method in your testing class to ensure the proper behavior of the graph with one vertex and edge.
